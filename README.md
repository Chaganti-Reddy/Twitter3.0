## :file_folder: Datasets

The dataset used can be downloaded here - [Click to Download](https://github.com/Chaganti-Reddy/Face-Mask-Detector/tree/main/Face-Mask-Detector/dataset)

This dataset consists of **7388** images:

- `face_no_mask`: 3,846 images
- `face_with_mask`: 3,542 images

Each image is a cropped real-world face image of unfixed sizes.

The images used were real images of faces wearing masks. The images were collected from the following sources:

- **Kaggle datasets** ([See here](https://www.kaggle.com/))
- **RMFD dataset** ([See here](https://github.com/X-zhangyang/Real-World-Masked-Face-Dataset))

```
These are some of the images of datasets.

### Data Preprocessing

Labeled data of masked faces is hard to come by, which is why we decided to set the overall still limited set of real masked faces that we have collected apart for validation and testing. Artificially generated masks that are used for training are generated as follows:

1. Detect the face in the image
2. Find the face landmarks, more specifically we need the location of the nose and chin
3. Apply an image of a mask to the face with the position based on the face landmarks

This strategy is based on the description that you can find in the [prajnasb/observations repository](https://github.com/prajnasb/observations).
We apply different masks with different shapes and colors to generate training data, which you can find in [dataset/mask-templates](https://github.com/Chaganti-Reddy/Face-Mask-Detector/tree/main/Face-Mask-Detector/dataset/with_mask). Below you can see an example of a mask being artificially applied.

## :link: Download

The dataset is now available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QHnwvLpOHpUdhFRc9W3yIPP42iwaeIq8/view?usp=sharing)! (December 28, 2021)

## :key: Prerequisites

All the dependencies and required libraries are included in the file <code>requirements.txt</code> [See here](https://github.com/Chaganti-Reddy/Face-Mask-Detector/blob/main/Face-Mask-Detector/requirements.txt)

## ðŸš€&nbsp; Installation

1. Clone the repo

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Chaganti-Reddy/Face-Mask-Detector.git
```

2. Change your directory to the cloned repo

```
$ cd Face-Mask-Detector
```

3. Now, run the following command in your Terminal/Command Prompt to install the libraries required

```
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt

```

## :bulb: How to Run

1. Open terminal. Go into the cloned project directory and type the following command: (For training purpose only..)

```
$ python3 Training.py
```

- If you want to test directly run this command without above command..

2. To detect face masks in real-time video streams type the following command:

```
$ python3 Face_Mask_Detect.py
```

## :key: Results

#### Our model gave 98% accuracy for Face Mask Detection after training via <code>tensorflow-gpu</code>

####

#### We got the following accuracy/loss training curve plot(for less no.of attempts)

#### We will get more accuracy if we try more no.of epochs(attempts)
